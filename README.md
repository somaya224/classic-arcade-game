# Classic Arcade Game Clone #
## Overview ##
<p>This game has been made using Canvas and Vanilla JS (no frameworks have been used).</p>
<p>This is the third project for my Udacity frontend Nanodegree Program.</p>
<p>Udacity provided us with visual assets and a resources.js file and a game loop engine.js file.</p>
<p>My task was working on the app.js file and use OOP concepts and features to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.</p>
<p>I made the game include score and player lives and the game has three levels each one is depending on your score.</p>
