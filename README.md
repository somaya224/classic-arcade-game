# Classic Arcade Game Clone
## Overview
This game has been made using Canvas and Vanilla JS (no frameworks have been used).
This is the third project for my Udacity frontend Nanodegree Program.
Udacity provided us with visual assets and a resources.js file and a game loop engine.js file witch I made a ninor changes to it add heart image to Resources.load() function.
My task was working on the app.js file and use OOP concepts and features to add a number of entities to the game including the player characters and enemies to recreate the classic arcade game Frogger.
I made the game include score and player lives and the game has three levels each one is depending on your score.
